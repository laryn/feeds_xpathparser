Feeds XPath Parser
======================

Feeds XPath Parser is a Feeds plugin for parsing XML and HTML documents. It enables site builders to leverage the power of Feeds to easily import data from complex, external data sources. Each element you wish to extract is setup using configurable mapping queries, saving time for developers who would otherwise have to code complex, specific-use modules. It also enables end-users to build web scrapers and other useful tools within Backdrop.

You may need this module if you would like to:

- Import XML or HTML documents into nodes, users, taxonomy terms, or regular database tables
- Scrape webpages like regular feed sources with scheduling, updating, and expiring
- Extract content from HTML documents to create a semantic data bank or mashup

Features
------------

- Builtin query debugger to assist with writing XPath queries
- Tidy support for badly formatted markup

- Various workarounds that cover up PHPâ€™s idiosyncrasies with XPath
